    <h1>Joaquín Cubelli de León</h1>
    <h2>Electrical Engineer | Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer</h2>
    <p>I'm a graduate Electrical Engineer from the University of Chile currently working as a Data Scientist. 
        <br> 
        I like working on projects that aim to improve the world that we live in, generating real value to the human race.
        <br>
        I'm proficient in Python, SQL, and know a lot of GCP products and services and lately I have been working on trying to reach a next step by integrating the Backend solutions I make into usable solutions by real users.
        <br>
        I'm always ready for a new challenge.
